# Test If Arduino Sketch Was Uploaded

## Quick Test: Check Arduino Serial Output

### Step 1: Open Arduino IDE Serial Monitor
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Click: **Tools → Serial Monitor**
3. Set baud rate: **115200** (bottom right)
4. You should immediately see:
   ```
   RFID Reader Ready
   MFRC522 Version: 0x92
   ```

### Step 2: Test Read Command
1. In Serial Monitor, type: `READ`
2. Press Enter
3. Place card on reader
4. You should see: `UID:XXXXXXXX` within 1-2 seconds

### Step 3: Test Write Command (THE CRITICAL TEST)
1. In Serial Monitor, type: `WRITE:50`
2. Press Enter
3. **IMMEDIATELY** place card on reader (or keep it there if still present)
4. Watch what happens:

#### If OLD Code (Not Uploaded):
```
(waits 3 seconds silently)
ERROR:No card detected for writing (timeout)
```

#### If NEW Code (Uploaded Successfully):
```
STATUS:Ready to write - place card now...
STATUS:Still waiting for card...
STATUS:Card detected, writing...
OK:WROTE:XXXXXXXX:50.00
```

## The Difference

### OLD Code Problems:
- ❌ No status messages
- ❌ Only 3 second timeout
- ❌ Doesn't work after first write
- ❌ Silent - you don't know what it's doing

### NEW Code Features:
- ✅ Shows "STATUS:Ready to write"
- ✅ Shows "STATUS:Still waiting..." every 2 seconds
- ✅ 10 second timeout
- ✅ Multiple writes work
- ✅ LED blinks every 2 seconds while waiting

---

## If You See OLD Code Behavior

### You MUST upload the sketch:

1. **File → Open**
   - Navigate to: `arduino_example\rfid_reader_example.ino`
   - Click Open

2. **Tools → Board**
   - Select your Arduino (probably Arduino Uno)

3. **Tools → Port**
   - Select COM3 (or whichever shows your Arduino)

4. **Click Upload Button** (→)
   - Wait for "Done uploading"
   - LED will blink during upload
   - Arduino restarts automatically

5. **Verify**
   - Open Serial Monitor again (115200 baud)
   - Type: `WRITE:50` + Enter
   - Should now see STATUS messages!

## If You See NEW Code Behavior But Python Still Fails

Then the issue is different:

### 1. Card Not Staying on Reader
- Place card FLAT on reader
- Keep it STILL for full 5 seconds
- Don't hover - must be touching

### 2. Card Not Compatible
- Must be MIFARE Classic 1K
- Hotel keycards usually work
- Some ID cards work
- Credit cards DON'T work

### 3. Hardware Problem
- Check wiring (see UPLOAD_NOW.md)
- Make sure MFRC522 is powered by 3.3V (NOT 5V!)
- Try a different card

### 4. COM Port Conflict
- Close Arduino Serial Monitor before running Python app
- Only ONE program can use COM3 at a time

## Still Stuck?

Run this test and report results:

```
1. Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud)
2. Type: READ + Enter
3. Place card
4. Result: ___________________

5. Type: WRITE:50 + Enter
6. Keep card on reader
7. Result: ___________________
```

Send me those results and I'll know exactly what the problem is!
