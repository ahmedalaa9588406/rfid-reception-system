### 2. **Add Balance (Top-Up)**
**Purpose**: Add money to a card's existing balance.

**Steps**:
1. Read or load a card first (see above)
2. Enter the amount to add in the **"üí∞ Top-Up Amount"** field

## Connection Status

**Top Right Indicator**:
- **‚óè Connected (COM3)**: Arduino is connected and ready
- **‚óè Disconnected**: No Arduino connection (use Manual Mode)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Card Not Reading
1. Check connection status indicator
2. Ensure Arduino is properly connected
3. Try reading the card again
4. Use Manual Mode as fallback

### Receipt Not Printing
1. Check if printer is set as default (Windows)
2. Receipts are always saved as PDF in `receipts/` folder
3. Open PDF manually and print

### Balance Incorrect
1. Use **"üé´ View All Cards"** to verify balance in database
2. Use **"‚úç Set Balance"** to correct the amount
3. Check transaction history for discrepancies

### Manual Mode Issues
1. Ensure card UID is correct format
2. Card will be created if it doesn't exist
3. Remember: Manual mode doesn't update physical cards

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always read the card first** before any operation
2. **Verify the balance** shown on screen before proceeding
3. **Keep receipts** for record-keeping
4. **Use Manual Mode** only when Arduino is unavailable
5. **Print card summaries** periodically for audit purposes
6. **Check transaction history** regularly in the reports

---

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Physical Card vs Database**:
- **Arduino Mode**: Updates both physical card AND database
- **Manual Mode**: Updates ONLY database (not physical card)

‚úÖ **Receipt Storage**:
- All receipts are saved in the `receipts/` folder
- Named with transaction ID and timestamp
- Can be reprinted anytime

üìä **Audit Trail**:
- All card reads are logged
