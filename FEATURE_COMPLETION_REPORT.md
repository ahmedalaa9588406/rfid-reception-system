## Technical Specifications

### Architecture

**Design Pattern**: Mode-based operation with single unified interface
- **Arduino Mode**: Reads/writes physical RFID cards + updates database
- **Manual Mode**: Manual UID entry + database-only updates

**Key Components**:
1. Toggle mechanism for mode switching
2. Validation layer for manual UID input
3. Conditional logic in top-up workflow
4. Transaction marking for audit trail

### Data Flow

#### Arduino Mode Flow:
```
User clicks "Read Card" → Arduino reads RFID → Display UID & balance
User enters amount → Click "Top-Up" → Arduino writes card → Update database
```

#### Manual Mode Flow:
```
User checks "Use Manual Entry" → Enter UID manually → Click "Load Card"
Validate UID → Display balance → User enters amount → Click "Top-Up"
Skip Arduino write → Update database only → Mark as "Manual entry mode"
```

### Database Schema Impact

**No schema changes required** - Uses existing tables:
- `cards` table: Stores card UIDs and balances
- `transactions` table: Records all transactions

**Transaction Marking**:
- Manual transactions include `notes='Manual entry mode'`
- Maintains complete audit trail
- Easy filtering and reporting

### Validation Rules

**UID Validation**:
- Must not be empty
- Must contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), and underscores (_)
- Validation regex: `uid.replace('-', '').replace('_', '').isalnum()`

**Examples of Valid UIDs**:
- `CARD-123-456`
- `USER_789_ABC`
- `RFID12345678`
- `TEST-CARD-001`
